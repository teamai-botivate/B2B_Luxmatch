# LuxeMatch B2B User Manual

This guide explains the complete LuxeMatch B2B flow: manufacturer, store/retailer, and end customer. It also explains authentication, test credentials, what button to press, and where data is stored in Supabase.

## Quick Start

Run the app:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\prabh\Desktop\LuxeMatch
pnpm.cmd dev
```

For full visual search and embedding tests, also run the embedder:

```powershell
python -m uvicorn embedder:app --port 8001
```

Seed/demo credentials:

> **Staff Portal entry point (live site):** Go to any page → scroll to footer → click **Staff Portal**. This opens `/portal` where you choose Store Owner Login or Manufacturer Login.

Main demo IDs:

| Entity                      | ID                                       |

## System Actors

LuxeMatch has three actors:

1. **Manufacturer**

   - Uploads and manages the global wholesale catalog.
   - Creates store accounts.
   - Receives B2B orders from stores.
   - Receives kiosk orders from end customers (via stores).
   - Updates B2B order and kiosk order status.

2. **Store / Retailer**

   - Logs in using store email/password at `/store/login` or via `/portal`.
   - Browses manufacturer catalog and places B2B restock orders.
   - After manufacturer delivery, products appear in the store's customer-facing inventory.
   - Views kiosk orders placed by walk-in customers.
   - Manages store branding (store name shown to customers).

3. **End Customer**

   - Uses the store kiosk/site — **no login required**.
   - Browses products, image-searches, AR try-on, adds to guest cart.
   - Fills a short guest form (name, phone, address/pickup) at `/kiosk-checkout`.
   - Order goes directly to the manufacturer. Store tracks and handles handover.

## Authentication And Authorization

| Cookie              | Who gets it    | Created by                       | Used for                                    | Tenant source              |
| ------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `lm_manufacturer` | Manufacturer   | `/api/manufacturer/login`      | Manufacturer portal/API                     | `manufacturerId`         |
| `lm_store`        | Store/Retailer | `/api/store/login`             | Store B2B portal + B2B mode jeweller routes | `jewellerId` inside cookie |
| `lm_pin`          | Staff/device   | `/api/shop/unlock`             | Jeweller back-office                        | `SHOP_JEWELLER_ID`       |

> **Customer login/signup is deprecated.** Customers order as guests. The `/login` and `/signup` routes redirect to home.

Two tenant modes:

- **Device mode:** `SHOP_JEWELLER_ID` is set in `apps/web/.env.local`. Staff unlock `/jeweller/*` using PIN.
- **B2B store mode:** `SHOP_JEWELLER_ID` is blank. Store logs in at `/store/login`; `lm_store` carries the correct `jewellerId`.

## Manufacturer Flow

### 1. Login

Navigate to the portal:

```text
/portal  →  Manufacturer Login  →  /manufacturer/login
```

Or go directly:

```text
/manufacturer/login
```

Enter:

```text
admin@atplusjewellers.com
manufacturer123
```

Click **Sign in**.

What happens:

- Frontend calls `POST /api/manufacturer/login`.
- Password is checked with bcrypt against `manufacturers.password_hash`.
- Server sets `lm_manufacturer`.
- You land in the manufacturer portal.

Database:

- Reads table: `manufacturers`
- Demo row ID: `10000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`

### 2. Dashboard

```text
/manufacturer/dashboard
```

Shows:

- Total catalog designs.
- Active designs.
- Pending B2B orders.
- Recent B2B orders.

### 3. Manage Products

```text
/manufacturer/products
```

Buttons:

- **Add Product**: opens product modal.
- Eye icon: toggles `active` / `draft`.
- Pencil icon: edit design.
- Trash icon: delete design.

Required fields:

- SKU, Name, Category, Base price, Status (`active` to show to stores)

Optional:

- Weight, Metal, Purity, Gemstones, Occasion tags, Style tags, Min order qty

What happens:

- Add → `POST /api/manufacturer/products`
- Edit → `PATCH /api/manufacturer/products/:id`
- Delete → `DELETE /api/manufacturer/products/:id`

Database:

- `manufacturer_products`
- `manufacturer_product_images`
- `manufacturer_product_embeddings`

### 4. Manage Stores

```text
/manufacturer/stores
```

- **Add Store**: creates a new store login linked to a jeweller tenant.
- Toggle: activate/deactivate store account.

Add Store form fields:

- Store Name, Email, Password, Jeweller ID, City, Phone

Demo linked jeweller ID:

```text
00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000d3e1
```

Database:

- `stores.id` — store account ID
- `stores.jeweller_id` → `jewellers.id`
- `stores.manufacturer_id` → `manufacturers.id`

### 5. Manage B2B Orders (Store Restock)

```text
/manufacturer/orders
```

Order detail:

```text
/manufacturer/orders/:id
```

Status flow — manufacturer controls:

| Current status | Button shown         | Effect                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `pending`    | **Confirm Order**    | Accept order                                    |
| `confirmed`  | **Mark Packed**      | Preparing                                       |
| `packed`     | **Mark Shipped**     | Add tracking number (optional)                  |
| `shipped`    | **Mark Delivered**   | Triggers `fulfillB2BOrder()` → store inventory |
| `delivered`  | —                    | Done                                            |
| `cancelled`  | —                    | Closed                                          |

**Mark Delivered** triggers:

1. `fulfillB2BOrder(orderId)` runs.
2. For each order item: product created in store inventory, images copied, try-on assets copied.
3. `b2b_orders.fulfilled_at` is set.
4. Product embedding/Qdrant indexing triggered.

### 6. Kiosk Orders (Customer Walk-in Orders)

```text
/manufacturer/kiosk-orders
```

Shows all guest orders placed by walk-in customers at any store kiosk. **Store name is highlighted prominently** for each order.

Expand an order to see customer details and items. Advance status buttons:

```text
placed → confirmed → packed → shipped → delivered
```

Manufacturer controls `placed → shipped`. Store controls `arrived_at_store → delivered_to_customer` (from their own kiosk orders view).

Database:

- `guest_orders`
- `guest_order_items`
- `guest_order_status_history`

## Store / Retailer Flow

### 1. Login

Navigate via portal:

```text
/portal  →  Store Owner Login  →  /store/login
```

Or go directly:

```text
/store/login
```

Enter:

```text
store@aurumheritage.com
store123
```

Click **Sign in**.

What happens:

- `POST /api/store/login` → bcrypt check → `lm_store` cookie set.
- Cookie contains `storeId` + `jewellerId`.
- Redirected to `/jeweller/dashboard`.
- All customer-facing pages are now automatically scoped to this store's `jewellerId`.

Database:

- Reads `stores`
- Demo store ID: `20000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`

### 2. Browse Manufacturer Catalog

```text
/jeweller/manufacturer-catalog
```

- Category filter and product cards.
- **Add** button: adds to sessionStorage B2B cart.
- Cart badge → `/jeweller/b2b-orders/new`.

Database:

- Reads `manufacturer_products`, `manufacturer_product_images`.
- No DB write until order placed.

### 3. Place B2B Order (Restock)

```text
/jeweller/b2b-orders/new
```

- Review cart, set quantities, add delivery address.
- **Place B2B Order** → `POST /api/store/orders`.
- Server resolves price from DB (client price not trusted).

Database:

- Inserts `b2b_orders`, `b2b_order_items`, `b2b_order_status_history`.

### 4. View B2B Orders

```text
/jeweller/b2b-orders
/jeweller/b2b-orders/:id
```

- **Cancel Order** available only when status is `pending`.
- Cancel → `DELETE /api/store/orders/:id`.

### 5. Kiosk Orders (Customer Walk-in Orders)

```text
/jeweller/kiosk-orders
```

Shows all guest orders placed by walk-in customers on this store's kiosk. Expand any row to see customer details and items.

Database:

- Reads `guest_orders`, `guest_order_items` filtered to this store's `store_id`.

### 6. Store Profile / Branding

```text
/jeweller/store-profile
```

- Edit `logo_url`, `tagline`, `website_url`.
- **Save branding** → `PATCH /api/store/branding`.
- Customer-facing pages show: **Store Name · LuxMatch · Powered by Botivate**.

Database:

- Updates `stores.logo_url`, `stores.tagline`, `stores.website_url`.

## End Customer (Kiosk Guest) Flow

> **No login required.** Customers use the store device as a guest. No account is created.

### 1. Browse Products

```text
/
/catalog
```

- Browse product cards, open detail, save/compare.
- Add to guest cart (stored in sessionStorage, resets per tab).

### 2. Image Search

```text
/search/image
```

- Upload jewellery photo → native OpenCLIP search → results from this store's Qdrant collection.
- Requires embedder running and products indexed.

### 3. AR Try-On

```text
/try-on
```

- Pick AR-ready product, start camera, capture.
- Only shows products for current `jeweller_id`.

### 4. Guest Checkout (No Login)

```text
/kiosk-checkout
```

Cart icon in header → `/kiosk-checkout`.

Customer fills:

- Name (required)
- Phone (required)
- Email (optional)
- Pickup at store OR delivery address
- Notes (optional)

Click **Place Order** → `POST /api/kiosk/orders`.

What happens:

1. Server resolves store from `lm_store` cookie or `SHOP_JEWELLER_ID` env.
2. Resolves store's manufacturer.
3. Prices looked up from DB — never trusted from client.
4. Inserts `guest_orders`, `guest_order_items`, `guest_order_status_history`.
5. Returns `{ id, orderNumber }`.
6. Customer sees success page with order number.

Database:

- `guest_orders`
- `guest_order_items`
- `guest_order_status_history`

> **Note:** After placing, the customer gets a receipt page only. No account, no email (unless SMTP is configured). The store and manufacturer can track the order from their portals.

## Portal Entry Point

The `/portal` page is the staff login hub. It is linked from the footer of every customer-facing page under **Staff Portal**.

```text
/portal
  ├── Store Owner Login  →  /store/login  →  /jeweller/dashboard
  └── Manufacturer Login →  /manufacturer/login  →  /manufacturer/dashboard
```

Customers never need to visit `/portal`. It is intentionally subtle (small text in footer).

## Data Flow End-To-End

### Manufacturer Design → Store Inventory (B2B Restock)

```text
manufacturer_products.id
  → store adds to B2B cart
  → store places b2b_orders
  → b2b_order_items.manufacturer_product_id
  → manufacturer marks status = delivered
  → fulfillB2BOrder():
      products row created (jeweller_id = store's jeweller)
      product_images copied
      product_tryon_assets copied (is_tryon=true images)
      product_embeddings / Qdrant indexed
```

### Customer Kiosk Order Flow

```text
Customer browses /catalog (no login)
  → adds to guest cart (sessionStorage)
  → fills /kiosk-checkout form
  → POST /api/kiosk/orders
  → guest_orders row (store_id + manufacturer_id + customer snapshot)
  → manufacturer sees it in /manufacturer/kiosk-orders
  → store sees it in /jeweller/kiosk-orders
  → status advanced: placed → confirmed → packed → shipped → delivered
```

### Tenant Isolation

Every store/customer product/order is scoped by `jeweller_id`.

In B2B mode:

```text
lm_store cookie → jewellerId → API context shopJewellerId
```

In device mode:

```text
SHOP_JEWELLER_ID env → API context shopJewellerId
```

## Pending Migration (Apply Before Testing Guest Orders)

Migration `0006_guest_orders.sql` must be applied in Supabase SQL editor before the kiosk order flow works end-to-end:

```text
supabase/migrations/0006_guest_orders.sql
```

This creates:

- `guest_orders`
- `guest_order_items`
- `guest_order_status_history`
- Adds `logo_url`, `tagline`, `website_url` to `stores`

## Test Checklist

### A. Migration And Seed

Run in Supabase SQL editor in order:

1. `0004_customer_avatar.sql` (if not applied)
2. `0005_b2b_platform.sql` (if not applied)
3. `0006_guest_orders.sql` ← required for kiosk order flow

Verify:

```sql
select id, email from manufacturers;
select id, email, jeweller_id from stores;
select id, name, status from manufacturer_products limit 5;
select table_name from information_schema.tables
where table_name in ('guest_orders','guest_order_items','guest_order_status_history');
```

### B. Portal Entry Test

1. Open any customer-facing page (e.g. `/`).
2. Scroll to footer, click **Staff Portal**.
3. Confirm `/portal` opens with two cards: Store Owner Login, Manufacturer Login.
4. Click Store Owner Login → `/store/login` opens.
5. Click back, click Manufacturer Login → `/manufacturer/login` opens.

### C. Manufacturer Portal Test

1. Open `/manufacturer/login`, login.
2. Confirm `/manufacturer/dashboard` loads.
3. Check products, stores, orders, kiosk-orders tabs.

### D. Store Portal Test

1. Open `/store/login`, login.
2. Confirm `/jeweller/dashboard` loads.
3. Browse manufacturer catalog, add to B2B cart, place B2B order.
4. Check `/jeweller/kiosk-orders` (may be empty until guest order is placed).

### E. Kiosk Guest Order Test

1. As customer (no login), go to `/catalog`.
2. Add a product to cart.
3. Go to `/kiosk-checkout`.
4. Fill name + phone, choose pickup.
5. Click **Place Order**.
6. Confirm order number appears on success page.
7. Log in as manufacturer → `/manufacturer/kiosk-orders` → order appears.
8. Log in as store → `/jeweller/kiosk-orders` → same order appears.

### F. B2B Fulfillment Test

1. Place a B2B order as store.
2. Log in as manufacturer → `/manufacturer/orders`.
3. Advance through all statuses to **Mark Delivered**.
4. Verify store inventory has new products:

```sql
select id, name, jeweller_id, manufacturer_product_id, stock_count
from products
where manufacturer_product_id is not null
order by updated_at desc;
```

## Common Errors

### Policy Already Exists

```text
policy "service role all manufacturers" already exists
```

Fix: Run `0005_b2b_repair_existing.sql` then rerun `0005_b2b_platform.sql`.

### Guest Orders Table Does Not Exist

```text
relation "guest_orders" does not exist
```

Fix: Apply `supabase/migrations/0006_guest_orders.sql` in Supabase SQL editor.

### Store Login Works But `/jeweller/*` Redirects

Check:

- `lm_store` cookie exists.
- Store row has `jeweller_id`.
- In B2B mode, `SHOP_JEWELLER_ID` can be blank.

### Image Search Fails

Check:

- Embedder running on port `8001`.
- `EMBEDDER_URL=http://localhost:8001`.
- Qdrant env vars valid.
- Products have images and are indexed.

## Recommended Demo Script

Use this in a presentation:

1. Open customer-facing site. Show products, AR try-on.
2. Add product to guest cart → go to `/kiosk-checkout` → fill form → place order.
3. Show order number on success page.
4. Open footer → Staff Portal → Manufacturer Login.
5. Show kiosk order in `/manufacturer/kiosk-orders` with store name.
6. Open footer → Staff Portal → Store Owner Login.
7. Show kiosk order in `/jeweller/kiosk-orders`.
8. Show store owner browsing manufacturer catalog → place B2B restock order.
9. Switch back to manufacturer → advance B2B order through to **Mark Delivered**.
10. Show new products in store inventory.

Complete business loop:

```text
Customer walks in (no login)
  → browses kiosk → guest cart → /kiosk-checkout → order placed
  → manufacturer sees it → fulfills → ships to store
  → store hands over to customer

Store owner restock:
  → browses manufacturer catalog → B2B order
  → manufacturer delivers → store inventory auto-updated
  → customer can now buy the restocked item
```
